🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection – Machine Learning Project

🚀 What’s Inside

This project uses Machine Learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
We feed the model past transaction data (both legit and fraudulent), and it learns patterns that help it predict if a new transaction might be suspicious.

Key steps in the project:

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning & preparing the dataset (handling imbalance, scaling features).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding the data through charts, stats, and insights.

Model Training – Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to detect fraud.

Evaluation – Checking how well the model works using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions, with each transaction labeled as fraudulent (1) or genuine (0).

Due to privacy concerns, no real credit card numbers are used.

If you want to try it yourself, you can grab the dataset from Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

NumPy, Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – ML algorithms & evaluation

Recall: High enough to catch most frauds without flagging too many legit transactions.
